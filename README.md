# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave me the following tasks to assist in completing an audit of a recent local congressional election.

These are a number of my findings after writing the script needed for this project:

The total number of votes were: 369,711.
Denver came out on top with a large majority of the total votes for the counties we examined, coming in just above 80%. Jefferson had about 1.5 times the amount of turnout that Arapahoe and both of them together don't even reach a fifth of the total votes for the counties.
As for the candidates, they also had one sweeping majority in our winner, Diana Degette, who had a grand total of 73.8% of the total votes in all 3 counties. Charles pulled in a respectable 23%, but not nearly what he needed to win and Raymon had a barely noticeable 3% of the total votes cast.

## Summary
In conclusion, we can see that this script provides more than adequate information on which candidate won and just how well they  and each other person in the running performed. With only a couple of adjustments to the names and counties involved, it could be used to assess the outcome of any election the board deemed necessary. My suggestion for an addition to the script to make it even more encompassing would be to allow for each candidate to see where their votes came from, meaning how well they did in each county. Also, being able to see the demographic of the voters that supported each candidate would be helpful as well so that they know where their support is coming from as well as who they're not reaching with their message.
